# Data Structure and Algorithms Using C

this is the Basic of DSA in C, here have all code of some basics, like- Array, Linklist, Graph, Tree, etc

## 1. Array --

- Insertion of any position
- Deletion of any position

## 2. Searching Algo-

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## 3. Shorting Algo-

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Marge sort
- Quick sort

## 4. LinkList

    A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes that together represent a sequence

- Single linklist
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Traversal
- Dubbly linklist
- Circular linklist

## 5. Stack-

        A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)

- Stack implementation using Array
- Stack implementation using Array not use Structure
- Stack implementation using Linklist
- Application - Infix to Postfix
- Application - Parenthesis matching

## 6. Queue-

        A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

- Queue implementation using Array
- Queue implementation using Linklist
- Circular Queue implementation using Array

## 7. Tree-

        A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search.
        Here we basically study of Binary tree, which has the most 2 nodes and the least 0

- Checking Binary Search Tree
- Search in BTS
- Travels in BTS
- Insertion in BTS
- Deletion in BTS
- AVL Tree
- AVL Tree Rotation

## 7. Graph-

        A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

- BFS search
- DFS search
